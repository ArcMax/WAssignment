Coding Challenge Android

Functional Requirements
You will need to connect to Stackoverflow Users API Endpoint and retrieve the first page of data. FULL API documentation
Display the retrieved data through a RecyclerView or a ListView.
We expect from you to display at least username, badges and gravatar for every user.
While the gravatar is being downloaded, the UI should show a loading animation.
Each of the photos should be downloaded only once and stored for offline usage.
The UI should always be responsive.

->Loding RecyclerView Linear on Potrait & Grid on Landscape
->Displaying username, badges and gravatar on cardview
->loading animation with shimmer library-> choose it for better user experience
->For fetching from Api-> used retrofit library 
->Photos will download only once-> as an extended version for this codei would choose content provider.
->UI is responsive-> As per manual testing i'm handling most of corner cases.
